This is a Facebook-like program that allows private chats, group chats, and micro-blog posts with a manager interface. This program uses Swing for a basic graphical user interface. It emphasizes on the usage of Oracle database for storing relational generated by this program. Additional manager interface allows more intuitive database management and easier statistical information.

## Installation

We are using ant to automate compiling, testing, and running. <br />
To run the program: `ant run`

## Usage

* As a user, you can view contact list after logging in. From the contact list, you can start a new private chat, or a group chat. You can also invite new contact to a group chat or accept an invitation. <br />
Newly generated information are immediately saved to database.

* As a manager, you can add new users, search for posts with keywords, and generate summary reports.
